### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I've just finished wasting 3 months on a Data Science course with HyperionDev. 

### Why do I say that I have wasted the 3 months?

Although I have managed to pick up some skills as data scientist, this happened only thanks to Youtube, which has a plethora of information on this subject. Despite the fact that I've learned barely nothing about data science, I've learned some basic Python programming skills. 

The saying that you get what you pay for it perfectly applies for this (mis)education company ðŸ˜„.

Just to make it clear, I was never interested in learning Python. My point was to learn **data manipulation**. Perhaps that's the reason, why I enrolled to **data science** course and not the software developer course.

Thanks for your attention!
